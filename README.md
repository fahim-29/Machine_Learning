# Machine_Learning
Machine Learning assignment completed as part of the PW Skills Data Analytics in Business course. This project demonstrates Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, detection and treatment of multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), and other key ML concepts implemented using Python.


# 📊 Regression Analysis – PW Skills Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the **Regression Assignment** as part of the **PW Skills - Data Analytics in Business** program.

The notebook demonstrates a complete workflow involving:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Detection and treatment of **Multicollinearity** using **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**
- Model evaluation using R², MSE, and RMSE

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- 📈 **Simple Linear Regression**: Relationship between a single predictor and the target variable.
- 📉 **Multiple Linear Regression**: Modeling with multiple independent variables.
- 🧮 **Multicollinearity Detection**: Using VIF to identify correlated features.
- 📊 **EDA & Visualization**: Including pairplots, correlation matrices, and scatter plots.
- 🧪 **Model Evaluation**: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
